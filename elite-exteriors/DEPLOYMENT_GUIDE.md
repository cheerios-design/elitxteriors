- [ ] Environment variables configured

### 2. Environment Variables Setup

### 3. Deploy to Netlify

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build

# Or push to your connected Git repository
git add .
git commit -m "Add blog interaction system"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Configuration

export default function AdminPage() {
  // Add basic password protection
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    // Implement your authentication logic here

  }
