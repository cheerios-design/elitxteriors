### Data Flow

```
User Action → Component → Local Storage → Netlify Form → Email Notification
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.production` file in your project root:

```env
# Email Configuration (for notifications)
EMAIL_USER=your-notification-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-specific-password

# Notification Recipients
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_1=sam.d@cheeriostudios.com
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_2=info@elitexteriorsva.com
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate an App Password for "Mail"
4. Use this password in the `EMAIL_PASS` environment variable

### 3. Netlify Configuration

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add the email configuration variables:
   - `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
   - `EMAIL_PASS`: Your Gmail app password

### 4. Form Setup

The system automatically creates the following forms in Netlify:

- `blog-likes` - Stores like interactions
- `blog-unlikes` - Stores unlike interactions
- `blog-comments` - Stores submitted comments
- `blog-shares` - Stores share interactions
- `blog-notifications` - Triggers email notifications

### 5. Deployment

1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Verify forms are created in Netlify Dashboard > Forms
3. Test the functionality on your live site
4. Check email notifications are working

## Usage Guide

5. **CSRF Protection**: Built into Netlify Forms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Comments not appearing**: Check admin dashboard for approval
2. **Emails not sending**: Verify environment variables in Netlify
3. **Like button not working**: Check browser console for errors
4. **Share modal not opening**: Verify component integration

## API Endpoints

## Database Schema

### Netlify Forms Data Structure

**blog-likes**

```
{
  id: string,
  postSlug: string,
  postTitle: string,
  userIdentity: string,
  timestamp: ISO date
}
```

**blog-comments**

```
{
  id: string,
  postSlug: string,
  postTitle: string,
  userName: string,
  userEmail: string,
  content: string,
  timestamp: ISO date,
  approved: boolean
}
```

**blog-shares**

```
{
  id: string,
  postSlug: string,
  postTitle: string,
  platform: 'linkedin'|'facebook'|'twitter'|'copy',
  timestamp: ISO date
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Local Storage**: Used for caching to reduce API calls
2. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs in background
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
4. **Toast Notifications**: Provide immediate user feedback

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions

1. **Reply System**: Nested comments/replies
2. **User Authentication**: Account-based interactions
3. **Comment Reactions**: Thumbs up/down on comments
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed engagement metrics
5. **Automated Moderation**: AI-based content filtering
6. **Email Digest**: Weekly summary of all interactions

### Database Upgrade Path

If you outgrow Netlify Forms, consider migrating to:

- Supabase (recommended)
- Firebase Firestore
- MongoDB Atlas
- PostgreSQL with Prisma

## Support

For questions or issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review Netlify Forms dashboard
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify email configuration in Netlify settings

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The admin dashboard currently has no authentication. In production, you should:

1. Add password protection
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Use environment variables for sensitive data
4. Regular backup of form submissions
