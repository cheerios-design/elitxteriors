2. Click "Add notification"
3. Select "Email notification"
4. Configure:
   - **Email to notify**: `info@elitexteriorsva.com`
   - **Form**: Select "contact" form
   - **When to notify**: "On form submission"

## Form Configuration Details

### Static Form Definition (`public/__forms.html`)

```html
<form
  name="contact"
  netlify
  data-netlify="true"
  netlify-honeypot="bot-field"
  hidden
>
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
  <input
    type="hidden"
    name="subject"
    value="New Contact Form Submission from %{siteName}"
    data-remove-prefix
  />
  <input name="bot-field" style="display:none" />

  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="tel" name="phone" />
  <input type="text" name="service" />
  <input type="text" name="propertyType" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
</form>
```

### Contact Form Fields

- **name** (text, required): Customer's full name
- **email** (email, required): Customer's email address
- **phone** (tel, required): Customer's phone number
- **service** (select): Type of service needed
- **propertyType** (select): Residential/Commercial/Industrial
- **message** (textarea): Project details and requirements

### Spam Protection

- **Honeypot field**: `bot-field` hidden from users but visible to bots
- **Akismet integration**: Automatic spam filtering by Netlify
- **Form validation**: Client-side validation before submission

## Expected Email Notification

When a form is submitted, `info@elitexteriorsva.com` will receive:

**Subject**: New Contact Form Submission - Elite Exteriors
**From**: formresponses@netlify.com
**Reply-To**: [customer's email]
**Content**: All form field data in structured format

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Showing in Dashboard

- Ensure form detection is enabled
- Redeploy the site after enabling
- Check that `__forms.html` exists in public folder

### No Email Notifications

- Verify email notification is configured in Netlify dashboard
- Check spam folder for notifications
- Ensure `info@elitexteriorsva.com` is correct email address

### Form Submission Errors

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify form is posting to `/__forms.html`
- Ensure all required fields are filled

### Test Submissions Marked as Spam

- Use real email address (not test@test.com)
- Write realistic message content
- Don't submit multiple times rapidly

## Additional Configuration Options

### Custom Success Page

Currently shows success message in-page. To redirect to custom page:

1. Add `action="/thank-you"` to form tag
2. Create thank-you page

### Additional Spam Protection

To add reCAPTCHA:

1. Add `data-netlify-recaptcha="true"` to form tag
2. Add `<div data-netlify-recaptcha="true"></div>` where CAPTCHA should appear

### Webhook Notifications

To send data to external services:

1. Go to Notifications settings
2. Add "Outgoing webhook"
3. Configure endpoint URL and payload format

## Monitoring & Analytics

### View Submissions

- [Forms dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/projects/elitexteriorsva/forms) to view all submissions
- Export to CSV for analysis
- Mark spam/verified as needed

### Form Usage

- Monitor submission counts
- Track storage usage for file uploads
